/**
Determine the first non-repeated character in a word. For example, in abbcaf it should return c.
Do this in O(n) time with O(1) space.
*/

// NOTE 1: It assumes lowcase input: some conversion/adaptation could be introduced for completeness.
// NOTE 2: Works as long as the set of chars is < number_of_bits(int) (normally is 32)
// NOTE 3: The output is reconstructed from an Hexadecimal value where the result is the first bit (from right to left) set to "1"
// NOTE 4: It avoids to use of strlen to calculates the length of the input. This makes the solution a "2 * O(n) == O(n)" => VERY COOL
// NOTE 5: The space occupied is "O(1)" (constant) => 1 pointer, 2 support unsigned int, 2 solution-carrying unsigned int, 1 hashmap of SIZE_OF_ALPHABET int
